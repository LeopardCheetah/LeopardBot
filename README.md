v1 of a chess bot that will be able to play on lichess
https://lichess.org/@/LeopardBot


---

goals:
- the bot works and can play on lichess
- the bot is strong (in some sense)
- I learn some cool things

other notes:
- this bot will NOT use neural networks for evaluation function but rather tuned specific functions
    - aka i will not be making a nn but rather a "simple" eval function to win
