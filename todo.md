this will be a todo list for me  
I'll also keep the things that I've done (progress made)

---

Handshake:
- [ ] Make working terminal chess (no bot, just chess pieces and stuff)

Opening:
- [ ] Successfully connect to lichess API + read events
- [ ] Find a basic evaluation function 
- [ ] Code up a manual mode (for console playing, etc.)
- [ ] Play a game (or a few) against my bot

Middlegame:
- [ ] Find a better evaluation function
    - [ ] archive the other evaluation functions
- [ ] Make bot even stronger
- [ ] Be able to play from custom FEN
- [ ] Establish bot thinking time


Endgame:
- [ ] Alpha-beta/min-max tree pruning and stuff
- [ ] train the bot using chess positions??


Some cool features:
- [ ] Opening Book
- [ ] Tablebase from lichess for endgames (see links.md)
- [ ] Bot "selector" (chat feature?) to select the type of bot you're playing against


Wayyyy later:
- [ ] Optimize for different time controls (e.g. bullet == no tablebase, rapid == yes tablebase)
- [ ] Make this project available for everyone to fork (SETUP.md)
- [ ] chess.com api
