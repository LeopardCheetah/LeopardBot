(lowercase so it's less aggressive)

Goals of code here:
- Get an evaluation for the current position (probably in centipawns)
    - also look at tablebase calling
- get candidate moves + lines


potentially this folder will have a lot of files -- corresponding to those that work/are being tested and the ones used in the past
